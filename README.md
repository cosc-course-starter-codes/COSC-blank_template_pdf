# COSC PDF Repository
## Note:
You must download the appropriate PDF from canvas into this repo. To complete the assignment, write on the PDF and post it back to this repo. All answers <u><b>MUST BE HANDWRITTEN</b></u> on the PDF in the space provided. You can simply print the document and scan it in to this folder. Or you can use a tablet to edit the PDF. There are many ways to write on to a PDF (google it!), but it depends on what resources you have available. Please contact the instructor if you need help with this.
